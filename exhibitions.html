                <h2>Cosmology</h2></br>
                <p>
                    Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. 
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                <h2>Evolution</h2></br>
                <p>
                    For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. 
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. 
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2></br>
                <p>
                    From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. 
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                <h2>Robotics and AI</h2></br>
                <p>
                    The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future. 
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

                <h2>Ecology</h2></br>
                <p>
                    As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a 
                    sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. 
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
